## Repo contents:
### Vue Reading List: 
A reading list application developed with [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs) 3's Composition API, [Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia) and [Pinia Persist](https://github.com/Seb-L/pinia-plugin-persist). Please refer to the accompanying video for a full explanation of the app.

#### Vue Quick Start Default App:
A copy of the impressive scaffolding generated with [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue)
This is the default Vue starter project and has been provided with this repo as an enviroment where you can explore the structure and syntax of Vue without customised content.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) VSCode extension (and disable Vetur if currently installed)

[Vue Devtools](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
(fun for dynamic browser inspection but not required!)

### 1. Clone, download, or fork this repository.

### 2. Using VSCode, open either the root folder of the repo, or open just the vue-reading-list folder specifically.
